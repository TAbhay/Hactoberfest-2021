<h1>Minimum deletions to be done in given array such that every pair sum is a power of 2 ? </h1>

<h2>Explaination of Question</h2>
Given an array arr[] consisting of N integers the task is to find the minimum number of elements that should be removed, such that for every remaining element arr[i], there exists another element arr[j], (i!=j) such that the sum of arr[i] and arr[j] is a power of 2. If after any number of deletion, no such pair exists, print -1.
